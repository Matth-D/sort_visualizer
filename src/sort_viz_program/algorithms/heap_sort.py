# TODO: as training build on what I've learned tonight and recreate the maxheapify function on a simple array


input_array = [5, 91, 12, 8, 57, 35, 43, 26, 89]

# PSEUDOCODE

# GET ARRAY LENGTH
# START VALUE IS LEN(A) / 2 - 1
# AND ITERATE DOWN BY -1 TO ITERATE ON EACH SUBTREE ROOT
# EACH HEAPIFY ITERATION TRICKLES DOWN TO THE LARGEST ESTABLISHED NODE
